## Simple Calc Project
Just a simple calculator written in Symfony

## Motivation
Decided to use symfony, which while it's not my main MVC and I only have a little experience using it, 
would give me a chance to learn some of it's features and to get the latest version setup.
I opted for a strategy design pattern in this case, which while is overkill for this project is a good example of a
design pattern which can easily be extended.

I added a few basic tests, although with some more time I would have added some more specific cases and added some to 
test the form as well.  It has some exception handling, although nothing amazing and the view doesn't position the
error messages nicely on the front end.

## Installation
symfony server:start
